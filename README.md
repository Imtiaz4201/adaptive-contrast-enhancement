<h1>Improved Adaptive Contrast Enhancement</h1>

<p>This work presents an enhanced version of Adaptive Contrast Enhancement, achieved by integrating and refining the methodologies from two seminal research papers(<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309234778_An_adaptive_gamma_correction_for_image_enhancement">An adaptive gamma correction for image enhancement</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6336819">Efficient Contrast Enhancement Using Adaptive Gamma Correction With Weighting Distribution</a>). By combining and modifying these established techniques, we have developed a superior Adaptive Contrast Enhancement approach.</p>
