<h1>Improved Adaptive Contrast Enhancement</h1>

<p>This work presents an enhanced version of Adaptive Contrast Enhancement, achieved by integrating and refining the methodologies from two seminal research papers(<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309234778_An_adaptive_gamma_correction_for_image_enhancement">An adaptive gamma correction for image enhancement</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6336819">Efficient Contrast Enhancement Using Adaptive Gamma Correction With Weighting Distribution</a>). By combining and modifying these established techniques, we have developed a superior Adaptive Contrast Enhancement approach.Unlike the method proposed in "Efficient Contrast Enhancement Using Adaptive Gamma Correction With Weighting Distribution," our improved algorithm calculates the weighting factor based on image contrast, rather than relying on a user-defined parameter.</p>
